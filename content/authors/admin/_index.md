Dr. Marco A. Molina-Montenegro is Full Professor at the University of Talca and is currently Vice Chancellor of the University. He has worked in different extreme environments (Atacama desert, alpine areas and Antarctica), where he has evaluated biological interactions -mainly microorganisms and plants- and their role in the establishment, distribution and ecophysiological performance. Dr. Molina-Montenegro has been characterized by promoting scientific collaborations with different countries (USA, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom) and Chile, through collaboration in multiple articles and scientific projects. In this way, Dr. Molina-Montenegro has opened opportunities for the training of graduate and undergraduate students through multiple initiatives and is currently part of the academic faculty of different graduate programs at the University of Talca. He additionally has been a sponsor of six postdoctoral researchers in the last years. His lab is very active, as he recently completed four projects and is currently developing another three, all of them primarily dealing with extreme environments, biological invasions, and climate change. His research group and his lines of research focus on how the symbiosis between microorganisms and plants can explain successful establishment, ecophysiological performance and the invasion process, in different stressful environments such as Antarctica, the Atacama Desert and the high mountains. However, other scientific challenges addressed in the laboratory are those related to food security, ecological restoration and how this could be improved through association with microorganisms from Antarctica and the Atacama desert. All this has resulted in a solid record of scientific publications and collaborations. He is also associate editor of three international journals and reviewer of articles for a significant number of journals and proposals for different agencies and countries. Finally, the results of the research have been actively channeled to national and regional decision makers, as well as impacting different settings ranging from high school to academics and government authorities.
